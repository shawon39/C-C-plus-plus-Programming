Pointers are used in C program to access the memory and manipulate the address.

Declaration of Pointer 
	int* p; 

As discussed, & is called reference operator. It gives you the address of a variable.

Likewise, there is another operator that gets you the value from the address, 
it is called a dereference operator (*).

Note: The * sign when declaring a pointer is not a dereference operator. It is just a similar notation that creates a pointer.

Common mistakes when working with pointers
Suppose, you want pointer pc to point to the address of c. Then,


int c, *pc;

// Wrong! pc is address whereas, c is not an address.
pc = c;  

// Wrong! *pc is the value pointed by address whereas, %amp;c is an address.
*pc = &c; 

// Correct! pc is an address and, %amp;pc is also an address.
pc = &c; 

// Correct! *pc is the value pointed by address and, c is also a value.
*pc = c;
